# vps-script

Here is a list of VPS Scripts that can be installed on Ubuntu. The main reason for this repo is so people can install these scripts with only 1 line of command.

## Debian

| Name              | :   | Command                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VNC Server + XFCE | :   | `bash <(curl https://yokowasis.github.io/vps-script/script/desktop-xfce.sh)` |
| OpenVPN           | :   | `bash <(curl https://yokowasis.github.io/vps-script/script/openvpn.sh)`      |

To look at the content of the script you can open them in the browser.

I will probably adding more script in the future. If you have any useful script you want to add to my website, feel free to contact me.
